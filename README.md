Fun with gemma and neopixel
===========================

Some mini-project(s) made for fun with a arduino gemma and an adafruit neopixel

Organization
------------

Each subdirectory is a mini project. Each project contains a README 
for some explanation about the projet, a [Fritzing](fritzing.org) file (`.fzz`)
describing the circuit for the project and an arduino program, stored inside a
folder.

Reproducing the circuit in the Fritzing file and running the arduino program
should give the expected behavior.

Other instructions given in the project's README supersede this file.

Required hard- and software
---------------------------

* A [gemma](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-gemma/ ) and an adafruit
  Neopixel, to the least
* some croco pincers, or a breadboard with some wires

* [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or equivalent
* [Fritzing](fritzing.org)
