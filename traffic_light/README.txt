Traffic light
=============

Make a traffic light with your neopixel

Extra hardware
--------------

* a resistor (*mandatory*: prevents a shortcut which might damage the gemma)
* (optional) a switch. This can be emulated by making a wire connected to Vout
  touch the wire of the resitor not connected to the groud. See fritzing file
  for details

Target behavior
---------------

When the switch is on, the neopixel emits green light, and red light when the
swith is off, thereby creating a single-bulb traffic light
